When the cells in the tumor are normal, it is benign. Something just went wrong, and they overgrew and produced a lump. When the cells are abnormal and can grow uncontrollably, they are cancerous cells, and the tumor is malignant.

Normal cells tend to stick together. ... Epithelial cells that are significantly enlarged may be a malignant cell. ï‚· Bare nuclei: This is a term used for nuclei that is not surrounded by cytoplasm (the rest of the cell). Those are typically seen in benign tumors.
